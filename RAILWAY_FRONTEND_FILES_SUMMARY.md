- `scripts/build-frontend.sh` - Unix/Linux/Mac build script
- `scripts/build-frontend.bat` - Windows build script
- Purpose: Automate the build process for the React frontend

### 2. Start Scripts
- `scripts/start-frontend.sh` - Unix/Linux/Mac start script
- `scripts/start-frontend.bat` - Windows start script

## Package.json Updates

### 1. Added Dependency
- Added `serve` package to dependencies for serving static files

- `start:frontend` - Runs the custom start script

## Environment Variables

The following environment variable needs to be set in Railway:

- `REACT_APP_API_URL` - The URL of your backend API service

## Deployment Process

1. Create a new Railway project
2. Connect your GitHub repository
3. Set the `REACT_APP_API_URL` environment variable
4. Railway will automatically:
   - Install dependencies using `npm install`
   - Build the React app using `npm run build`
   - Serve the built files using `serve -s build`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Build Failures**
   - Ensure all dependencies are properly listed in package.json
   - Check that the build command works locally

2. **Application Not Loading**
   - Verify `REACT_APP_API_URL` is set correctly
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Ensure routing configuration is correct

3. **Routing Issues**
   - Make sure vercel.json or static.json routing rules are properly configured
   - Check that all client-side routes are handled correctly

### Logs and Monitoring

- Check Railway deployment logs for build errors
- Monitor application logs for runtime issues
- Use browser developer tools to debug frontend issues
